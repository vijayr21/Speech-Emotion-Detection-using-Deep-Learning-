# Speech Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **detecting emotions from speech signals** using deep learning techniques. The model can classify audio recordings into different emotion categories, providing insights into the speaker's emotional state.

---

## Features
- Classifies emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral**, etc.
- Preprocessing of audio data (feature extraction like MFCCs)
- Deep learning model implemented for high accuracy
- Works with real-time audio or prerecorded datasets

---

## Dataset
- Uses publicly available speech emotion datasets (e.g., RAVDESS, TESS)
- Audio files are preprocessed and converted into features suitable for deep learning models

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning
- **Librosa** for audio processing
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization
- **Flask** (or your web framework) for the web application
- **SQLite** for the database (`users.db`)

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prakash-Chandran/Speech-Emotion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning.git
cd Speech-Emotion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
bash
python -m venv venv
```
### Activate the environment:
#### Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install required packages:
- Run this in your Terminal with the actual path of the file located using ' cd file-path '
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage:
1.Place your audio files in the data folder (or follow the dataset structure provided)
2.Run the preprocessing script:
```
python preprocess.py
```
3.Train the Model  :
```
python train_model.py
```
4.Test the model with new audio samples:
```
python test_model.py --audio path_to_audio_file.wav
```

## Results:
  - The trained model can predict emotions with high accuracy on test datasets.
  - Example predictions: happy, sad, angry, neutral.
